Exciting announcement! After a successful experience with
[Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs) 2019,
we're putting out a call for writers to apply to work with DVC as part of the
[2020 edition](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs). If you want to get
involved with open source software documentation with mentorship from our team,
read on.

DVC has a well organized docs team and a
[well-defined process](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/contributing/docs) for
creating and maintaining our documentation, while working closely with the core
engineering team.

## Prerequisites to apply

Besides the general requirements to apply to Google Season of Docs, there are a
few skills we look for in applicants.

1. **Clear English writing.** We strive express the concepts, processes, and
   details around DVC clearly, correctly, and completely. We use general and
   friendly wording as much as possible and pay close attention to consistency
   in our terminology.

1. **Command line experience.** [DVC](/doc/home) is a command line tool that
   builds on top of [Git](https://git-scm.com/), so being able to play with it
   and test the features will be very useful. Creating and managing files,
   GNU/Linux commands, file and permission admin are desired skills.

1. **People skills.** We put a high value on communication: the ability to
   discuss ideas, explain your goals, report progress, and work kindly with more
   or less technical teammates.

If you like our mission but aren't sure if you're sufficiently prepared, please
be in touch anyway. We'd love to hear from you.

## Project ideas

Below are several project ideas that are an immediate priority for the DVC docs
team. We welcome writers to create their own proposals, even if they differ from
our ideas. Projects will be primarily mentored by our lead technical writer,
[Jorge](https://github.com/jorgeorpinel).

1. **DVC 1.0 docs.** We are soon to release DVC 1.0.0! This version brings some
   significant changes that for the first time in our
   [release history](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/releases) are not
   completely backward-compatible. The main change is a multi-stage _pipelines
   file_ that substitutes
   [DVC-files](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format). We expect the
   process to fully update all our previous docs will take a few months, and you
   could help us with this!

   _Difficulty rating:_ Beginner-Medium<br/><br/>

1. **Video tutorials.** Written documentation is great, but other media can also
   be important for our organization to reach a wide variety of learners.
   Expanding to video is also a core part of our developer advocacy strategy.
   One of DVC's priorities for the season is creating a library of video
   tutorials ranging from short explanations of basic DVC functions to more
   advanced use cases. You could assist in writing the scripts or even take the
   lead producing some videos, so image/video editing skills would come in handy
   (optional).

   **Mentor**: [Elle](https://github.com/andronovhopf)

   _Difficulty rating:_ Medium<br/><br/>

1. **Interactive guides.** Many of our docs include command line examples to
   illustrate how DVC works. In some cases these are full guides we want people
   to be able to follow by copying commands into their terminals. This has a few
   challenges: mainly keeping the rest of the document maintainable, brief, and
   easy to read; and supporting people on all platforms (Mac, Windows, Linux).

   So we started extracting some of the command examples into interactive
   [Katacoda scenarios](https://www.katacoda.com/dvc) to match certain docs,
   however they are in need of maintenance and completion, as well as being
   embedded into the corresponding pages per
   [this issue](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/issues/670).

   This may involve working with our front-end team or, preferably, having some
   Javascript coding experience.

   _Difficulty rating:_ Medium-Advanced

1. **Javascript engine UI/UX.** Our website has custom
   [source code](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/tree/master/src) we've
   developed over the years to host our landing pages, docs, and blog all in a
   high-performance, advanced static site (Node.js, Gatsby, React, Typescript).
   We have several goals to further improve the usability and structure of our
   site, such as

   - creating a
     [special docs home page](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/issues/1073).
   - improving [mobile menus](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/issues/808).
   - better navigation sidebar
     [highlighting](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/issues/753) and
     [positioning](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/issues/1198).
